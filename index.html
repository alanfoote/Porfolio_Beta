        <h4>I will be out of the office and away from my computer during the dislosed timeframe, as I will be at a cabin in the woods either reading by a fire, building a puzzle, or playing in the snow. I will resume upkeep of this new website when I return. </a></h4>

        <h1>Welcome to my (beta) Website Portfolio.</h1>
        <p>For this project, I used a template from <a href="HTML5webtemplates.co.uk"><strong>HTML5webtemplates.co.uk</strong></a> which appear to have a more 'streamlined' template than the one I used from <a href="html5up.net"><strong>HTML5UP.NET</strong></a>. Eitherway, I'm very grateful for these services as they give me a 'sandbox' to play around in that has helped me understand the form and mechanics of web development, which also wouldn't be possible without the language primer you gave us.</p><p> To be honest, up to this point I have not been very 'proud' of my work, so I won't be making this site as a "real" professional portfolio, but I will attempt to do my best to show you my understanding of this new language within the knowledge that I have acquired, and will definitely have more work to show off by the end of my degree. So, thank you for getting this ball rolling.
